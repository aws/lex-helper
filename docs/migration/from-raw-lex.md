# Migrating from Raw Lex

!!! info "Coming Soon"
    This section is under development. Step-by-step migration guide will be available soon.

## Overview

Migrate your existing raw Amazon Lex Lambda functions to use lex-helper with minimal disruption.

## Migration Strategy

### Assessment Phase
Evaluating your current implementation for migration readiness.

### Incremental Migration
Migrating one intent at a time for safe transition.

### Testing Strategy
Ensuring functionality is preserved during migration.

### Rollback Plan
Safe rollback procedures if issues arise.

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Setup
Installing lex-helper and setting up the project structure.

### Step 2: Handler Conversion
Converting raw Lambda handlers to lex-helper handlers.

### Step 3: Session Migration
Migrating session attribute handling.

### Step 4: Response Migration
Converting response formatting to lex-helper patterns.

### Step 5: Testing
Comprehensive testing of migrated functionality.

## Before and After Examples

### Raw Lex Handler
```python
# Example of raw Lex handler (before)
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Raw implementation
    pass
```

### lex-helper Handler
```python
# Example of lex-helper handler (after)
from lex_helper import LexHelper
# Converted implementation
```

## Common Migration Challenges

### Session Attribute Conversion
Handling differences in session attribute management.

### Response Format Changes
Adapting to lex-helper's response formatting.

### Error Handling Updates
Updating error handling patterns.
